The mkknlimg and knlinfo utilities are now found in the scripts directory
of the Linux tree, where they are covered by the kernel licence.

Note also that the firmware shipped with 4.4 kernels now assumes the kernel
is Device Tree-capable unless there is a trailer to say otherwise, meaning
that these tools aren't needed for most situations.
